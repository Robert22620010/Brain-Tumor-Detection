# Brain-Tumor-Detection
# Project Title
  Brain Tumour Detection Using Machine Learning
# Problem Statement
  Brain tumours are one of the most critical neurological disorders. Manual detection from MRI images is time-consuming and prone to human error. There is a need for an automated    and accurate system to detect brain tumours at an early stage using machine learning techniques.
# Objective
  The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning–based system that can automatically detect the presence of a brain tumour from medical data (MRI
  images/dataset) with high accuracy and reliability.
# Dataset Description
  The dataset consists of brain data containing features related to tumour characteristics. It includes labeled data indicating whether a brain tumour is present or not.
  1. Data Type: Medical MRI data (CSV features)
  2. Classes: Tumour / No Tumour
  3. Source: Publicly available medical dataset (Kaggle)
  4. Dataset Source:   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jakeshbohaju/brain-tumor
     
     Due to large file size, the dataset is not uploaded to this repository
# Methodology / Approach
  1. Data collection and loading
  2. Data preprocessing and cleaning
  3. Feature selection and normalization
  4. Splitting data into training and testing sets
  5. Applying machine learning algorithms
  6. Model training and evaluation
  7. Prediction of brain tumour presence
# Tools & Technologies Used
  1. Programming Language: Python
  2. Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
  3. IDE/Platform: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
  4. Version Control: GitHub
# Steps to Run the Project
  1. Clone or download the project repository
  2. Install required Python libraries
  3. Load the dataset into the project directory
  4. Run the Python/Jupyter notebook file
  5. Train the model and test with user input data
# Results / Output
  The system successfully predicts whether a brain tumour is present or not based on the input data. The model achieves good accuracy and can assist medical professionals in early
  diagnosis and decision-making.
